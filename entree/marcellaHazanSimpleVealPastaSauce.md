## Ingredients
 - 3/4 pound fresh, ripe tomatoes or 1 cup canned imported Italian plum tomatoes
 - 3 tablespoons butter
 - 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
 - 1/4 cup chopped onion
 - 1/2 pound ground veal (or ground beef or pork)
 - Salt
 - Black pepper ground fresh
 - 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
 
## Notes
As with any party drink, be sure to use an a approximate 1:8 ratio of 80 proof liquor to other ingredients for safety. This keeps the drink's strength approximately the same as beer.

## Instructions
 1. If you are using fresh tomatoes, peel them by dipping them in boiling water for 1 minute, then squeeze off their skin.
 2. Halve the tomatoes, scoop out their seeds without squeezing, and chop up coarsely.
 3. Put 2 tablespoons of butter and the vegetable oil in a small saucepan and turn on the heat to medium high. Cook the onion, stirring from time to time, until it becomes colored a pale gold.
 4. Add the ground veal, and turn it over several times, using a wooden spoon, to brown it all over.
 5. Add the cut-up tomato, salt, and several grindings of pepper, and with your wooden spoon turn over all ingredients two or three times. Cook at a steady but gentle simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
 6. Cook and drain the pasta and toss it immediately and thoroughly with the sauce. Serve with grated Parmesan.
