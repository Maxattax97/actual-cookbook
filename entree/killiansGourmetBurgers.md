## Ingredients
 - 80% lean beef
 - Munster cheese slices
 - White onion
 - Golden Broiche buns
 - Mayonnaise
 - Ketchup
 - Eggs (optional)

## Instructions
 1. Pound all meat such that it no longer is stringy.
 2. Portion to be roughly 1/2 pound sized burgers. about 1.75 - 2.25 inches tall and the circumference the size of a circle made from connecting your index/thumb from both hands (use both index and thumbs and make a circle). The burgers edges are the tallest part, the 1.75 - 2.25 inches is in reference to the edges. Have the burger lower itself by about 0.5 inches as it reaches the center (i.e. 2.25 inches around the edges, 1.75 inches in the center)
 3. Cut onion slices.
 4. If you have bacon, throw that on the stove (set to med-high) and cook it completely. Keep the bacon grease. Otherwise, throw a dab of oil and swirl (enough to coat very lightly, no moving oil)
 5. Cook flat side of burger for 3 - 4 minutes, the greying of the beef should be roughly halfway to 3/4 the way there. DO NOT MESS WITH THE BURGER, the more you do the less it retains the flavor.
 6. Throw a slice of onion on top and flip, try to make sure the onion is the only thing in contact with pan (again, don't mess with burger too much, every action taken makes the burger lose flavor). 3 - 4 minutes this side. A good way to check is if you touch with your finger the patty, it should have some resistance to when you press. Developed over time. The first cooked side of the burger should not be charred at all, just a brown crust.
 7. Flip once more, put two slices of muenster cheese on top, creating 8 corners. Cook for 30 seconds, cheese won't be fully melted, the heat of the burger will do that as you take it off
 8. Toast the buns in the leftover pan grease for 20 seconds. Add bacon to top.
 9. Mayo (slather bottom, dab top) and ketchup are the only things needed for condiments
 10. Optionally add fried egg to top.
